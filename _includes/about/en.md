This is Albert·Leiming·Du, a coder who is working on NLP research, the founder of [Albert Future Lab](https://albert-leiming-du.github.io). I graduated from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University) in 2014. Then I worked in [China Southern Power Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Southern_Power_Grid) as an electrical engineer for more than three years. Now I am working at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_University_of_Technology_and_Design) as a researcher on Natural Language Processing field. My main insterets are Sentiment Analyasis, Word Representation and Question Answering System. I mainly write the code with ptyhton && C++, build the model with tensorflow, keras and dynet.

At most time, I am hanging around on some major social networks, like [Blog](https://albert-leiming-du.github.io)、[Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/albert.leiming.du)、[Twitter](https://twitter.com/albert_leiming)、[Github](https://github.com/albert-leiming-du). I keep making some binary garbage to waste the server and electricity resource.

I have built the opensource project called [OpenSentiment](https://github.com/AlbertFutureLab/OpenSentiment), to integrate some useful Sentiment Analyasis Structure for some common usage and keep maintaining. If you have any interests or problems about it, please feel free to drop me an [email](duleimingdo@gmail.com).
